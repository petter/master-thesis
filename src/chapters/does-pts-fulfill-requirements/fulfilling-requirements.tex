\chapter{Does PTS Fulfill The Requirements of PT?}\label{ch:does-pts-fulfill-the-requirements-of-pt?}

This thesis is concerned about implementing Package Templates in TypeScript.
However, in order to determine to what degree we have actually implemented PT or just created something that looks like it, we have to understand what the requirements of PT are, and if we are meeting those requirements.
We will therefore in this chapter look at the requirements as described in~\cite{jot}.
After getting an understanding of the requirements we are going to look at how our implementation holds up to them.

\section{Verifying Templates}\label{sec:pt-requirements-verifying-templates}

Talk about unsoudness of TypeScript.
Talk about unsoudness of Java~\cite{java-unsound}
Talk about since the requirement is met with Java we assume it is adequately met with TypeScript as well.

Before we look at what TypeScript is we first need to look at JavaScript.
JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification, and is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web\cite{jswikipedia}.

A web page generally consists of three layers of technologies.
The first layer is HTML, which is the markup language that is used to structure the web page.
Second is CSS which gives our structured documents styling such as background colors and positioning.
The third and final layer is JavaScript which enables you to create dynamic content for your website.
Whenever you visit a website that isn't just static information, but instead might have timely content updates, interactive maps, etc, then JavaScript is most likely involved\cite{whatisjs}.

When we create a JavaScript program/script for a web page we don't compile it and transfer a binary for the web page to execute, instead the browser takes the source code and interprets it\footnote{On a more technical level, JavaScript is generally just-in-time compiled in the browser.}.
Because of this each browser has its own implementation of the JavaScript interpreter.
Each browsers implementation of JavaScript should conform to the latest ECMAScript specification.

\subsubsection{ECMAScript Versions}

Talk about

\subsubsection{Backwards Compatibility}

With new ECMAScript versions comes new features, and it is up to each browser to implement these changes.
As we mentioned earlier, we do not transfer a binary to the client browser, we transfer the source code.
So when a JavaScript script uses a new ECMAScript feature it is not guaranteed to work with every client browser, since a lot of people might have an old browser installed, or the team behind the browser has not implemented the feature yet.
To deal with this a common practice in JavaScript development is to first transpile your source code before using it in a production environment.
This transpilation step takes your source code and transpiles it into an older ECMAScript version.
In doing this you ensure yourself that more client browser will be able to run your script.

Some popular transpilers for JS to JS transpilation are Webpack and Babel, but you could also use the TypeScript compiler.

\subsubsection{Node.js}

Node.js(hereby simply referred to as Node) is a JavaScript runtime built on the JavaScript engine, V8, used by Chrome.
It enables developers to utilize JavaScript elsewhere than in the browser.
Node is designed to build network applications

We will be using Node for our compiler.

\subsection{What is TypeScript?}\label{subsec:what-is-typescript}

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
The language builds on JavaScript with the additions of static type definitions\cite{tswebsite}.

All valid JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

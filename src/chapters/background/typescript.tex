\section{TypeScript}\label{sec:typescript}

Before we look at what TypeScript is we first need to understand JavaScript and the JavaScript ecosystem.

\subsection{JavaScript}\label{subsec:javascript}

Back in the mid 90s web pages could only be static, however there was a desire to remove this limitation and make the web a more interactive platform, as it became increasingly more accessible to non-technical users.
In order to remove this limitation, Netscape, with its Netscape Navigator browser, partnered up with Sun in order to bring the Java platform to the browser, and hired Brendan Eich to create a scripting language for the web.
Eich was tasked to create a Scheme like language with syntax similar to Java, and the language was intended to be a companion language to Java.
The language when it first released was called LiveScript, however it was later renamed to JavaScript.
This has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape in order to give the impression that it was a Java spin-off.

Microsoft, with its Internet Explorer, adopted the language and named it JScript.
During this time Microsoft and Netscape would both ship new features to the language in order to increase the popularity for their respective browsers.
Because of this war between browsers the language was later handed over to ECMA International as a starting point for a standard specification for the language.
This ensured that users would get the same experience across different browsers, making the web more accessible~\cite{jswikipedia}.

A web page generally consists of three layers of technologies.
The first layer is HTML, which is the markup language that is used to structure the web page.
Second is CSS which gives our structured documents styling such as background colors and positioning.
The third and final layer is JavaScript which enables web pages to have dynamic content.
Whenever you visit a website that isn't just static information, but instead might have timely content updates, interactive maps, etc., then JavaScript is most likely involved~\cite{whatisjs}.

JavaScript, or more precisely ECMAScript, is the programming language of the web.
It is a language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
ECMAScript is simply a JavaScript standard, created by Ecma International, made to ensure interoperability across different browsers.
There is no official runtime or compiler for JavaScript as it is up to each browser to implement the languages runtime.
When we create a JavaScript program/script for a web page we don't compile it and transfer a binary or bytecode file for the web page to execute, instead the browser takes the raw source code and interprets it\footnote{On a more technical level, JavaScript is generally just-in-time compiled in the browser.}.

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language with dynamic typing...

\subsubsection{ECMAScript Versions}\label{subsubsec:ecmascript-versions}

ECMAScript versions are generally released on a yearly basis.
This release is in the form of a detailed document describing the language, ECMAScript, at the time of release.
New versions will most likely include some additions to the language, but never any breaking changes\footnote{There has been occasions where there has been minor breaking changes between ECMAScript versions, but these changes happen very rarely and the affected areas are often insignificant.}.
This is because the developer will not be able to control the environment on which the code will be executed since you can not be sure which ECMAScript version the client browser is using.
Because of this lack of control over the runtime environment it is crucial that any pre-existing language features don't have breaking changes between versions.

\subsubsection{Backwards Compatibility}\label{subsubsec:backwards-compatability}

With new ECMAScript versions comes new features, and it is up to each browser to implement these changes.
As we mentioned earlier, we do not transfer a binary to the client browser, we transfer the source code.
So when a JavaScript script uses a new ECMAScript feature it is not guaranteed to work with every client browser, since a lot of users might have older browsers installed, or the team behind the browser has not implemented the language feature yet.
To deal with this a common practice in JavaScript development is to first transpile the source code before using it in a production environment.
This transpilation step takes the source code and transpiles it into an older ECMAScript version.
In doing this you ensure that more client browser will be able to run the script.
This will rewrite the new language features, and often replace them with a function, called a \textit{polyfill}.
You can think of a polyfill as an implementation of a new language feature that you ship with your code.
These polyfills help the developer regain some control over the runtime environment on which the code will be run on, and ensures that the code will run on almost any browser as expected.

Some popular transpilers for JS to JS transpilation are Webpack and Babel, but you could also use the TypeScript compiler for this.

\subsubsection{Node.js}\label{subsubsec:node}

As of the time of writing there are mainly two ways to execute JavaScript.
You can run the program in the browser, as it was intended, or you can use a JavaScript runtime that runs on the backend, outside of the browser.
Node.js (henceforth simply referred to as Node) is the mainstream solution for the latter.
Node is a JavaScript runtime built on the JavaScript engine, V8, used by Chrome.
It is independent of the browser and can be run through a \textit{CLI} (Command-Line Interface).
One major difference from the browser runtimes is that Node also supplies some libraries for IO, such as access to the file system and the possibility to listen to HTTP requests and WebSocket events.
This makes Node a good choice for writing networking applications for instance.

We will be using the Node runtime for our compiler since it gives us access to the file system, as well as enabling the compiler to be executed through a CLI, as is the norm for most compilers.
The compiler will still also be available as a library.

\subsection{What is TypeScript?}\label{subsec:what-is-typescript}

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
The language builds on JavaScript with the additions of static type definitions~\cite{tswebsite}.

All valid JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

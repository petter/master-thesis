\section{TS compiler fork vs Babel Plugin vs ...?}

\subsection{TypeScript Compiler Plugin}

Not possible at the time as the TypeScript compiler wiki specifies "TypeScript Language Service Plugins ("plugins") are for changing the editing experience only." \cite{tscplugin}. This might be possible in the future...

\subsection{TypeScript Compiler Fork}

Possible, however not as accessible as other alternatives and will make upkeep expensive.

\subsection{Preprocessor for the TypeScript Compiler}

\subsection{Babel plugin}

Babel isn't strictly for TypeScript, but for JavaScript as a whole. Will however make it very accessible as most web-projects use Babel, and the upkeep is cheap, as plugins are pretty independent from the core.

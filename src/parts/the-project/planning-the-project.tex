\section{Choosing the right approach}\label{sec:choosing-the-right-approach}

Before jumping into a project of this size it is important to find out what approach to use.
The end goal of this project is to extend TypeScript with the Package Templates language mechanism,
this can be achieved as following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Making a fork of the TypeScript compiler
    \item Making a preprocessor for the TypeScript compiler
    \item Making a Babel plugin
\end{itemize}

To get a better understanding for which approach to use we will be implementing a small language feature with each of the approaches named above.



\subsection{TypeScript Compiler Fork}

Possible, however not as accessible as other alternatives and will make upkeep expensive.

\subsection{Preprocessor for the TypeScript Compiler}

\subsection{TypeScript Compiler Plugin}

Not possible at the time as the TypeScript compiler wiki specifies "TypeScript Language Service Plugins ("plugins") are for changing the editing experience only." \cite{tscplugin}. This might be possible in the future...


\subsection{Babel plugin}

Babel isn't strictly for TypeScript, but for JavaScript as a whole. Will however make it very accessible as most web-projects use Babel, and the upkeep is cheap, as plugins are pretty independent from the core.
